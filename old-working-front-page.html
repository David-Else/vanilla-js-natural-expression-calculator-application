<h2>The Path to Happiness</h2>
Welcome to the world of 9-Energy Natural Expression: a wonderful opening to a new and happier life. It provides the answer to probably the greatest challenge you face: who you really are. It also gives insight and wisdom to accept and be at peace with what you find, not only within yourself, but with everyone around you. In short, it shows us the Path to Happiness.

The essence and power of 9-Energy Natural Expression lies in a book called the ‘I Ching’ or Book of Changes. Around 5000 years old, it fundamentally explains the laws of humanity and shows that everything that happens is the result of two equal but opposite interacting forces called Yin and Yang.

Many have acknowledged how influential the I Ching was in their lives and work: Apple founder Steve Jobs, psychoanalyst Carl Jung and Wolfgang Pauli, the Nobel Prize winning quantum physicist to name but a few. Also the musician Bob Dylan, who said “I don’t have any religion or philosophy, I can’t say much about them, but there is a book called the I Ching, I’m not trying to push it, I don’t want to talk about it, but it’s the only thing that is amazingly true, period.”
<h3>Find out your Natural Expression</h3>
The first step on your own Path to Happiness is discovering your 9-Energy Natural Expression. Simply complete the form on this page and I will email that back to you. From there you may want to know more, and if so you can book a <a href="http://naturalexpression.co.uk/consultations/">consultation</a> with me or order my book <a href="http://naturalexpression.co.uk/sex-love-and-who-puts-the-rubbish-out/">“Sex, Love and Who Puts the Rubbish Out?”</a>
<h3>Finally...</h3>
It's important to note that everything I tell you about this philosophy either here on the site or in the book is a lie! And they only stop being lies, when you can prove them true for yourself. You will of course make your own mind up – I was a total sceptic – but if you feel a connection with this philosophy, this could be the start of something really rather wonderful. It certainly was for me!
